## Pipeline:
1) slim -s <SEED> SimName.txt > seed_SimName.out
	katie@Katies-MacBook-Air:~/Desktop/RecombinationGenomeScans$ 
	
	slim -s 1236 simfiles/Recombination_LowRegions.slim > results/1236.out &
	gzip 1236_RecomLowReg_VCFallsim1.vcf

	
	-> outputs a vcf
	-> compress vcf to vcf.gz and overwrite
	-> will have 2 types of simulations: 
		--> low recom region
		--> inversion under neg. freq. dep. selection
	

3) post-process the vcf and create a mysql3 database for each simulation
	--> all mutation table
	--> filter fixed variants from VCF file
	--> assign individuals to populations on the landscape
	
4) Calc stats for different kinds of scenarios and store in db.
	--> loop through simulations
	--> tables for stats calculated in different kinds of scenarios
			--> eg. stats calculated on all data
			--> stats calculated on LD-pruned data
5) Calc summaries
	--> loop through mysql files

Starting simulation project to show the effect of LD on genome scans.

Found with SliM on my laptop, can simulate up to about 500,000 bases. 
Using all the CPU but not all the memory for some reason.

TO DO:
- test GEA
- test low He vs. LD trimming
- run 50 replicate of each simulation
- run Hscan
	> H-scan -m -i 1509520718392_Invers_outputMS.txt > 1509520718392_H.txt

- run R code to analyze datasets and store results in RDS
