The populations have been differentially fished, such that you have populations from low, medium, and high fishing pressure. \n\n{\n\\vspace{0.2cm}\n}\n\\noindent\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt,parsep=2pt]\n  \\item First, you have to design PCR primers for a putatively neutral microsatellite locus (repeat section bolded):\n  \n  5'-TCGGCTA\\textbf{CAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAG}ATGGTAC-3' \n  \n  What primers would you design for the forward primer and reverse primer (\\textbf{2 points}, be sure to use the correct notation that would be sent to the sequencing company):\n  \n  \\iftoggle{solution} {\n    \\begin{ans}\n      Forward: 5'-TCGGCTA\n      Reverse: 5'-GTACCAT\n    \\end{ans}\n    }\n  {\n    \\vspace{3cm}\n  }\n\n  \\item After ordering the primers, you survey these populations at this locus and find that it has two alleles: size 100 and size 103. You have obtained the following data for the three populations:\n  << eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE >>=\ndat <- data.frame(Pop=c(\"Low\", \"Med\", \"High\"), n100100=c(5,15, 34), n100103 = c(12, 15, 13), n103103 = c(23, 12, 24))\ndat\n@\n\nDetermine whether the \"HIGH\" population has allele frequencies in HWE proportions.

You also have designed primers for the GRPX gene in cichlids that is responsible for growth rate and age of maturity. Fish collected from the ``HIGH'' fishing pressure population mature at a smaller size than fish from the ``LOW'' population.

The sex ratio is balanced, with equal numbers of males and females.\n\n{\n\\vspace{0.2cm}\n}\n\\noindent\n\\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt,parsep=2pt]\n\n  \\item What is effective population size?

Explain in your own words the reason for the discrepancy and propose a measure that might more accurately reflect contemporary $N_e$.  \\textbf{2 points}\n  \n\\iftoggle{solution} {\n\\begin{ans}\n$N_e$ is larger than N, because there was a recent bottleneck and there has not been sufficient time for inbreeding to occur. This measure of $N_e$ is a measure of inbreeding $N_e$, which is going to reflect the number of parents or the $N_e$ of previous generations. In other words, the existing puffin colony still possesses much of the genetic diversity of their grandparents, but this will erode over time.\n\nInstead, we might want to try to measure variance $N_e$ based on the variance in allele frequencies from one time point to the next.\n\\end{ans}\n}\n{\n\\vspace{12cm}\n}\n\n \\item You survey genotype counts at a locus and obtain the following data.

Do you think this is an accurate estimate? Why or why not? \\textbf{2 points}\n  \n\\iftoggle{solution} {\n\\begin{ans}\n$h_{t}=(1-\\frac{1}{2N_e})^t h_0$\n\n$h_{10} = (1-1/(2*51.2))^{10}*0.21\n\n$h_{10} = 0.19$\n\nThe actual loss of heterozygosity would be much larger, because as the population starts to inbreed the effective population size would decrease much faster. So assuming constant $N_e$ in this population is a bad assumption.\n\n\\end{ans}\n}\n{\n\\vspace{12cm}\n}\n\n \n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\section*{Question 3: Native honeybees (10 points)}\n\nYou are studying \\emph{Andrena accepta}, a solitary honeybee native to North America that nests in the ground. Bees are randomly distributed across wooded landscapes.  In temperate areas, Andrena bees (both males and females) emerge from the underground cells where as prepupae they spend the winter. They mate, and the females then seek sites for their nest burrows, where they construct small cells containing a ball of pollen mixed with nectar, upon which an egg is laid, before each cell is sealed. The egg then hatches into a prepupae over the winter and the cycle continues.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt,parsep=2pt]\n\n  \\item Would it be more appropriate to use the term `dispersal' or the term `migration' to describe movement of individuals in this metapopulation population and why? \\textbf{2 points}\n\n\\iftoggle{solution} {\n\\begin{ans}\nDispersal, because it's the probability that an individual moves from position I to position J, because this is a continuous population. Migration is used to describe the probability that a individual moves from population I to population J.\n\\end{ans}\n}\n{\n\\vspace{8cm}\n} \n  \n  \n  \\item Why does dispersal or migration not equal gene flow? \\textbf{2 points}\n\n\\iftoggle{solution} {\n\\begin{ans}\nDispersal is a function of an individual’s movement probability (or it’s offspring), while gene flow depends on dispersal and the number of individuals that disperse.\n\\end{ans}\n}\n{\n\\vspace{12cm}\n} \n  \n  \\item You have collected data on the mitochodrial genomes from bee populations located across New York and Massachusetts. You've found that genetic distance ($F_{ST}$) increases with geographic distance at a rate of 0.003 per km. From demographic data, you've also measured the effective density of the bee populations to be 0.3 individuals per square kilometer. What is the estimated parent-offspring axial dispersal distance of the species? \\textbf{2 points}\n\n\n<< eval=evalthis, echo=echothis >>=\nDe=0.3\n(sigma <- 1/sqrt(De*4*0.003))\n@\n\n{\n\\vspace{6cm}\n} \n\n  \\item What is the neighborhood size of the bee populations and what does this measure mean? \\textbf{2 points}\n  \n  \\iftoggle{solution} {\n\\begin{ans}\nThis is the effective number of bees that are connected by dispersal around a focal location\n\\end{ans}\n}\n{\n\\vspace{6cm}\n} \n\n<< eval=evalthis, echo=echothis >>=\nDe=0.3\n(sigma <- 1/sqrt(4*De*0.003))\n(NS=4*pi*sigma^2*De)\n@\n  \n  \\item Given that this study used mtDNA, how would the estimate of dispersal change if chromosomalor nuclear SNPs were used instead? \\textbf{2 points}\n\n\n   \\iftoggle{solution} {\n\\begin{ans}\nmtDNA would have a lower Ne and experiencing higher drift compared to nuclear DNA.\nThus, De would also be lower and the slope between genetic distance and geographic distance would be lower in nuclear DNA, and estimates of sigma (dispersal) would be larger.\n\\end{ans}\n}\n{\n\\vspace{12cm}\n} \n\n  \n\\end{enumerate}\n\\clearpage\n.\n\\clearpage\n.\n\\newpage\n\\input{../equations-test1-2017.tex}\n\n\\end{document}\n",
